# NEA-sentiment-playlist-generator

This project explores the intersection of machine learning and music recommendation.
It uses sentiment analysis to classify text input from the user into different emotions, and then generates a playlist that the gradually transitions from the detected emotion to the user's emotion of choice.

A dataset of 1,000 songs is mapped onto a 2D Valenceâ€“Arousal graph, allowing a graph traversal algorithm to find a smooth emotional path between the starting and target moods.

ðŸ§  Modeling: trained on a labeled dataset of emotions using neural networks.

ðŸŽµ Application: maps predicted sentiment â†’ emotion-sensitive playlist generation.

ðŸ’¡ Goal: demonstrate how AI can bridge natural language understanding and personalized music experiences, including potential applications in music therapy.
